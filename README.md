# Information display of the Guild of Physics

New version of the information display made to solve its [predecessor]() problems with maintainability and perfomance. Made with React.

New features:
- intelligent pages: page visibility and duration on the screen is easily configured
- easier to maintain(?)

Removed features:
- less emphasis on animations
- a bit less lörinä

### Usage
Clone repo, `npm install`, `npm start`, enjoy. Some of the content require browser extension that bypassed CORS restrictions (for example [Cors Everywhere](https://addons.mozilla.org/fi/firefox/addon/cors-everywhere/)) to work properly.

### Contributing
Adding new pages to the infomation display is simple. Just take a look `Example.js` to see how page works. Contact [guild's Communications Officer](mailto:viestintavastaava@fyysikkokilta.fi) if you want to contribute.
